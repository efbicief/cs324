			<h2>How to play</h2>
			<p>Use the left mouse button to move around the map, the right mouse button to rotate the map,a nd the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.</p>
			<p>Your objective is to deliver people to their destination stations. Over time, people will appeat at stations - you can see how many people are waiting at a station by selecting "Create Journey" and hovering over a platform.</p>
			<p>To place train tracks, select "Place rails" and draw rails between stations. Each station has 2 platforms. Be careful, tracks are permenant! When placing, you cannot place tracks that are too short or long, or at an extreme angle.</p>
			<p>To send trains between stations, you must create a journey by selecting "Create Journey", and selecting the platforms you wish your train to go to in order.</p>
			<p>To delete a journey, or change the frequency of trains on a journey, use the "Manage Journeys" menu.</p>
			<p>You may pause the game by clicking "Pause", or opening any other menu.</p>
			<p>The game ends once the time reaches 500. You will lose 50 points for each train journey, and gain 1 point for each person delivered to their destination, so make sure to plan your journeys well. Good luck!</p>
